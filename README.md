## Players start in the Nether
### Made for Minecraft version 1.18
#
This datapack will teleport a player to the nether one time, 

and set a tag (called "warped") on that player to prevent being teleported again.

This datapack is useful if you want to start in the Nether without enabling cheats.

If you use it, please credit me :)

Good luck
